\section*{Required Syllabus Statements}
\url{https://www.depts.ttu.edu/tlpdc/RequiredSyllabusStatements.php}
\subsection*{ADA STATEMENT:}
Any student who, because of a disability, may require special arrangements in order to meet the course requirements should contact the instructor as soon as possible to make any necessary arrangements. Students should present appropriate verification from Student Disability Services during the instructor's office hours. Please note: instructors are not allowed to provide classroom accommodations to a student until appropriate verification from Student Disability Services has been provided. For additional information, please contact Student Disability Services in Weeks Hall or call 806-742-2405.

\subsection*{ACADEMIC INTEGRITY STATEMENT:}
Academic integrity is taking responsibility for one's own class and/or course work, being individually accountable, and demonstrating intellectual honesty and ethical behavior. Academic integrity is a personal choice to abide by the standards of intellectual honesty and responsibility. Because education is a shared effort to achieve learning through the exchange of ideas, students, faculty, and staff have the collective responsibility to build mutual trust and respect. Ethical behavior and independent thought are essential for the highest level of academic achievement, which then must be measured. Academic achievement includes scholarship, teaching, and learning, all of which are shared endeavors. Grades are a device used to quantify the successful accumulation of knowledge through learning. Adhering to the standards of academic integrity ensures grades are earned honestly. Academic integrity is the foundation upon which students, faculty, and staff build their educational and professional careers. [Texas Tech University (“University”) Quality Enhancement Plan, Academic Integrity Task Force, 2010].


\subsection*{RELIGIOUS HOLY DAY STATEMENT:}
"Religious holy day" means a holy day observed by a religion whose places of worship are exempt from property taxation under Texas Tax Code §11.20. A student who intends to observe a religious holy day should make that intention known in writing to the instructor prior to the absence. A student who is absent from classes for the observance of a religious holy day shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment scheduled for that day within a reasonable time after the absence. A student who is excused under section 2 may not be penalized for the absence; however, the instructor may respond appropriately if the student fails to complete the assignment satisfactorily.

\subsection*{STATEMENT OF ACCOMMODATION FOR PREGNANT STUDENTS:}
To support the academic success of pregnant and parenting students and students with pregnancy related conditions, the University offers reasonable modifications based on the student's particular needs. Any student who is pregnant or parenting a child up to age 18 or has conditions related to pregnancy may contact Alex Faris, the Texas Tech University designated Pregnancy and Parenting Liaison, to discuss support available through the University. The Liaison can be reached by emailing alfaris@ttu.edu. Should a student communicate with the instructor that they are pregnant or have a pregnancy related condition or may need additional resources related to pregnancy or parenting, the instructor will communicate that student's information to the Title IX Coordinator, who will work with the student and others, as needed, to ensure equal access to the University's education program or activity. 

For more information regarding supportive measures, please contact pregnancy \& parenting liaison Alex Faris (alfaris@ttu.edu : 806.834.3420) or visit \url{https://www.depts.ttu.edu/titleix/PregnacnyandParenting/index.php}.

The instructor will work to provide students with the ability to handle wildlife species with minimal stress, thus decreasing the risk of injury to people and animals. It is imperative that students follow instructions and communicate any discomfort with assigned activities. Please see link for additional information on animal-borne diseases: \url{https://www.depts.ttu.edu/iacuc/Zoonoses_Guidelines.php}

\section*{AI Use Syllabus Statements:}
\url{https://www.depts.ttu.edu/tlpdc/AI_Resources/AI-Use-is-Encouraged.pdf}
\subsection*{AI Use is encouraged and allowed in your course:}
You may use generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools (such as ChatGPT) in this class, as doing so aligns with our course learning goals. Your use of AI tools must be properly documented and cited. You are responsible for ensuring the information you submit based on an AI query does not contain misinformation, unethical content, or violate intellectual property laws. Submission of AI-generated content as your own work is a violation of academic integrity and may result in referral to the Office of Student Conduct. Please contact your instructor if you have questions regarding this course policy.\footnote{AI responses are often incorrect; be sure the response makes sense, is correct, and grammatically edited.  AI responses must be disclosed in your work.}

\section*{ADDITIONAL COURSE SPECIFIC POLICIES:}
\subsection*{Cellphones/Pagers: }
Please set your personal communication devices to silent ring or off during class. Do not take calls in class. Disturbance during class time is not acceptable.
\subsection*{Prerequisites:} 
Mastery of material from CE 3305 or equivalent is expected.
\subsection*{Attendance:} Roll will be taken to determine attendance for class participation.  Please let the instructor know in advance if you must miss a class for a legitimate reason\footnote{Legitimate reasons include: Academically-related extracurricular activities (ASCE, AGU, etc.); Illness with documentation; Federal Family Leave Act Policies; Orders to activate (Military, Peace Officer, Public Health, etc.).  Show me some kind of documentation for such absences.}. 

\section*{Evaluation Instruments and Grading}
Student performance will be evaluated using attendance (coming to class), homework, project reports, and examinations.   The examinations will derive much of their content from the exercises.  %At the end of the semester students are to turn in a portfolio of all graded work.  The portfolio should be comprised of photocopies of exercise materials, and exams 1 and 2.  The project report should be submitted under separate cover.  The portfolio should be bound using a binder clip.  The portfolio will not be returned.  

%\subsection*{Article Reviews:} 
%Several article reviews are assigned; part of professional development is reading and interpreting professional literature.  Due dates for these reviews are shown in Table \ref{tab:fall2014schedule}.  These reviews are shown as \texttt{R-\#}.

\subsection*{Homework:} 
Homework assignments are distributed and collected using Blackboard.  Check frequently as the semester proceedes.  Due dates are on Blackboard.  
These exercises are scored (usually) on a 100 point criteria\footnote{Legibility, correct method, and correct answer are components of the criteria.   
The grader will not diagnose sources of arithmetic or algebra errors unless the errors are obvious.  
Once solutions are presented in class and/or posted on the server, the maximum point allowance is substantially reduced}.

\subsection*{Semester Project:}  
A semester project comprised of various components developed during the course is to be completed by teams of 3 people.  
A presentation and final report are required (all team members will submit a final report).\footnote{Team size is dictated by class size, at the time of this writing the total class size is integer divisible by 3; partial people are not viable.}

\subsection*{Exams:} One mid-term examination and one final examination is scheduled.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Examinations are open notes.
\item Examinations are comprehensive, even though the main focus will be the materials discussed prior to the examination.
\item Full credit for problems will only be given if all computations are documented.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Grading:} Final grades are determined based on performance during the semester.  Letter grades will be assigned using University standards.  The \textbf{approximate} weighting of graded material in determining the final grade is as follows\footnote{Graded materials with fewer than 100 points will have raw scores reported and will be normalized to 100 points for calculating the final grade.}:
