    "Academic integrity is taking responsibility for one’s own class and/or course work, being individually accountable, and demonstrating intellectual honesty and ethical behavior.  Academic integrity is a personal choice to abide by the standards of intellectual honesty and responsibility.  Because education is a shared effort to achieve learning through the exchange of ideas, students, faculty, and staff have the collective responsibility to build mutual trust and respect.  Ethical behavior and independent thought are essential for the highest level of academic achievement, which then must be measured.  Academic achievement includes scholarship, teaching, and learning, all of which are shared endeavors.  Grades are a device used to quantify the successful accumulation of knowledge through learning.  Adhering to the standards of academic integrity ensures grades are earned honestly.  Academic integrity is the foundation upon which students, faculty, and staff build their educational and professional careers.

    "“Religious holy day” means a holy day observed by a religion whose places of worship are exempt from property taxation under Texas Tax Code §11.20.  A student who intends to observe a religious holy day should make that intention known to the instructor prior to the absence.  A student who is absent from classes for the observance of a religious holy day shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment scheduled for that day within a reasonable time after the absence.  A student who is excused may not be penalized for the absence; however, the instructor may respond appropriately if the student fails to complete the assignment satisfactorily.\n",
