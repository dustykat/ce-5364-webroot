# # USGS MOC Windows Build
# 
# You may find the build on the USGS website won't run on your computer. Options at this point are to get a FORTRAN compiler and build it yourself from source code, or you can use a build from around 1997 that I tested on a Windows computer.

# [WINMOC_32.exe (compiled for Windows) circa 1997](http://54.243.252.9/ce-5364-webroot/ce5364notes/chapters/12usgsmocmodel/winmoc/bin/WINMOC_32.exe)

# When you get the program and an example input file put it somewhere on your computer

# Supply the input file name

# When it is completed, the terminal closes by itself
