# ___
# 
# ## Purpose : 
# Demonstrate ability to apply principles of groundwater contaminant transport
# 
# ## Additional Instructions
# 
# The test is intended to be completed on blackboard.  The questions below are transcribed to BB as (in general) `file response` questions or in the short answer part, as essay response.

# <hr>
# 
# ## Problem 1 (10 points)
# 
# In a plan view of a contaminant plume you observe that a conservative constituent (e.g. chloride) has moved about 1500 meters while a reactive constituent (e.g. chromium) has moved only 400 meters. Both species were released at the same time.
# 
# Determine:
# 
# 1. Sketch the situation
# 2. An estimate of the distribution coefficient of the reactive species if the porosity is 0.35 and the solids density is 2.22 g/mL.

# 
# Determine:
# 
# 1. The equilibrium concentration of chlorobenzene in soil air with this water, in mg/L

# 
# ## Problem 3 (20 Points)
# 
# A cubic meter of sand-gravel aquifer is contaminated with 20 L of tetrachloroethylene (PCE). The aquifer has porosity of 20% and hydraulic conductivity of 410 m/d. You may assume that the air content is negligible.
# 
# Determine:
# 1. Sketch the situation
# 2. The equilibrium concentration of PCE in the water phase.
# 3. The mass of PCE in the water phase.
# 4. What is the mass PCE in the NAPL phase.
# 5. If the aquifer gradient is 0.001 estimate how long it would take to completely dissolve and flush the PCE from the cubic-meter source zone.

# ## Problem 4 
# 
# A fuel mixture includes benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene at mole fractions of 0.075,0.065, and 0.035 respectively.  The mixture is allowed to come to equilibrium with the atmosphere at 25$^o$C

# A leak in a storage tank for radioactive waste results in an accidental release of 1000 ci (curie) of 10 yr cooled fission products and tritium.  The waste contains 400 ci Cs-137(t$_{1/2}$=33yr),400 ci Sr-90(t$_{1/2}$=28yr),100 ci Pm-147(t$_{1/2}$=2.7yr), and 100 ci H-3(t$_{1/2}$=12.26yr).  A stream exists 100 m downgradient of the release.  The groundwater velocity is 0.1 meters per day. Other data:

# *A useful analytical solution is found as Eq. 2 in [A Probabilistic Framework for the Assessment of Environmental Effects in Groundwater Contaminant Hydrology](http://www.scienpress.com/Upload/GEO/Vol%2010_5_5.pdf).  Equation 6.28 (textbook) is an identical equation*

# 
# ## Problem 5 (20 points)
# 
# Dissolution of constituents from a residual NAPL source results in a contaminant plume whose maximum length is determined by the balance between advection and decay. 
# 
# Determine:
# 1. Develop an expression (or a method) for the plume length (from source to target MCL value) if the source-term concentration is $C_0$. 
# 2. Apply the expression (or method) to estimate the maximum length of a benzene plume whose equilibrium concentration in water at the source is 2.4 mg/L and whose MCL is 0.005mg/L. Assume that the pore velocity is 0.35 m/d and the half-life of the benzene in a first order decay model is 60 days. Assume that the retardation coefficient for benzene in the aquifer is 2.

# ## Problem 6 (10 points)
# 
# Consider an MTBE plume originating from a leaky gasoline storage tank.  The free-phase gasoline contains MTBE at 0.2 mole-fraction. The seepage velocity is $1~ \frac{ft}{d}$ and the half-life for first-order decay of MTBE (from biochemical activity) is $T_{1/2} = 365~day$ and the retardation coefficient for MTBE in the auqifer is $R=1.1$.
# 
# Determine:
# 1. The MTBE concentration in the water phase at the source.
# 2. The anticipated plume length from the source to a concentration limit of $C=20~\frac{\mu g}{L}$
