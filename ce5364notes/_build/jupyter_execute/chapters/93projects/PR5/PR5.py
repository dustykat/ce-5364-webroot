# # Chemflow 2000 Project 2
# 
# This project is a self-training exercise using the Chemflow software.
# 
# Perform the selected numerical experiments that are found at the end of the [CHEMFLO manual](http://54.243.252.9/ce-5364-webroot/3-Readings/ChemfloManual.pdf).   Perform the tasks as required by the problem statements.  Save screen captures that prove you did the work.  Provide text to answer the questions as stated in the numerical experiments.
