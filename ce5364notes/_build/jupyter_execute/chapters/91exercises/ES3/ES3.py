# ## Problem 1 (Problem 6-7, pg. 588)
# 
# An instantaneous release of biodegradable constituients occurs in a 1-D aquifer. Assume the mass released is $1.0 ~kg$ over a $10~m^2$ area normal to the flow direction, $\alpha_l = 1.0~m$, the seepage velocity is 1.0 $\frac{m}{day}$, and the half-life of the decaying constituient is 33 years.
# 
# Determine:
# 
# 1. The maximum concentration at 100 meters from the source.
# 2. Plot a concentration history (annual intervals) for a 40 year period from release date for a location 100 meters from the source.

# ## Problem 2 (Problem 6-9, pg. 589)
# 
# An unintentional discharge from a point source introduced $10~kg$ of contaminant mass to an aquifer. The seepage velocity is $0.1~\frac{ft}{day}$ in the $+x$ direction.  The longitudinal dispersion coefficient is $D_x = 0.01 \frac{ft^2}{day}$ the transverse dispersion coefficients are $D_y = D_z = 0.001 \frac{ft^2}{day}$.
# 
# Determine:
# 
# 1. Calculate the maximum concentration at $x=100~ft$ and $t=5~years$.
# 2. Calculate the concentration at $(x,y,z,t) = (200~ft,5~ft,2~ft,5~years)$

# 
# ## Problem 3 (Problem 6-10, pg. 589)
# 
# Apply the Domenico and Schwartz (1998) planar source model (pg. XXX) to a case of a continuous source that has been leaking contaminant into an aquifer for 15 years.  The source had a width $Y=6~m$ and depth $Z=6~m$. The source concentration is $10~\frac{mg}{l}$. The seepage velocity is $0.057~\frac{m}{day}$. The longitudinal, transverse, and vertical dispervities are $1~m$,$0.1~m$, and $0.01~m$ respectively.
# 
# Determine:
# 
# 1. The contaminant concentration history at a location $x=200~m$ from the source using 1-year increments for 30 years.

# 
# 1. The Linear isotherm equation for these data (i.e. fit the isotherm model to the data), plot the isotherm and data
# 2. The Freundlich isotherm equation for these data, plot the isotherm and data
# 3. The Langmuir isotherm equation for these data, plot the isotherm and data
# 4. Which isotherm model produces the best fit for these data?
