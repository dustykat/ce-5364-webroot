# **LAST NAME, FIRST NAME**

# **R00000000**
# 
# <hr>
# 
# ## Purpose : 
# Apply selected risk assessment methods
#  
# ## Assessment Criteria : 
# Completion, results plausible, format correct, example calculations shown.  
# 

# <hr>
# 
# ## Problem 1 
# 
# Improper waste disposal practices at an industrial site resulted in contamination of the soil on site by cadmium, a known carcinogen with a slope factor of 6.10 $(\frac{mg}{kg d})^{-1}$. We will consider the risk to off-site residents due to inhalation of airborne soil particles that include the cadmium.  Based on monitoring data, the concentration of cadmium in the air off site is $5.4 \times 10^{-4}~\frac{mg}{m^3}$.
# 
# Determine:
# 
# 1. CInh for residents that are children 1-6 years of age and adults.
# 2. The cancer risk due to these CInh values for the children and adults. 
# 
# Show all calculations and identify all parameter values used.

# 
# ## Problem 2 
# 
# The same site also caused off-site lead concentrations that can cause non-cancer effects on the residents. The RfD for lead is 6.90x10-4 $(\frac{mg}{kg d})^{-1}$.  We will consider dermal exposures in this problem, with a lead concentration of $260~\frac{mg}{kg}$ in the soil, and an absorption factor of 10 percent for the young children and 5 percent for adults. 
# 
# Determine:
# 
# 1. The NCDEX for residents that are children 1-6 years of age and adults. 
# 2. The hazard quotients due to these NCDEX values for the children and adults.
# 
# Show all calculations and identify all parameter values used.

# <hr>
# 
# ## Problem 3 
# 
# A contaminated groundwater that is a potential drinking water source has a manganese concentration of $0.36~\frac{mg}{L}$. The RfD for manganese is $0.10~\frac{mg}{kg \cdot d}$. We will consider effects on children 6-12 (drinking 1 L/d) and adults (2 L/d). 
# 
# Determine:
# 1. The NCIng for children 6-12 and adults drinking this water. 
# 2. The hazard quotients due to these NCIng values for the children and adults. 
# 
# Show all calculations and identify all parameter values used.

# <hr>
# 
# ## Problem 4 
# 
# An animal exposure study was performed to determine an acceptable drinking water concentration for a chemical that causes liver disease in rats and is assumed to have a nonzero threshold. The following results were obtained. 
# 
# **Control Group**
# Comparison to historical records: no evidence of premature deaths 
# Time of sacrifice: all surviving rats were sacrificed at 18 months 
# Initial number: 100 
# Number of rats with liver disease: 3 
# 
# **Test Group** 
# Exposure conditions (lowest observed effect): 140 mg/L, 30 mL/d for a median of 12 months 
# Time of sacrifice: all surviving rats were sacrificed at 18 months 
# Comparison of weight and survival curves: no differences between test and control rats 
# Median adult weight: 0.4 kg 
# Initial number exposed: 100 
# Number of rats with liver disease: 12 
# 
# Determine:
# 
# 1. The LOAEL for the rats based on this study.
# 2. The RfD for humans by adjusting for uncertainty. This result is subchronic animal data with no human exposure data available. 
# 3. Convert the RfD to an acceptable drinking water concentration.
