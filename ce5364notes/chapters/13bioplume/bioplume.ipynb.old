    "BIOPLUME III is a two-dimensional, finite difference model for simulating the biodegradation of hydrocarbons in ground water. The model simulates both aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation processes in addition to advection, dispersion, sorption and ion exchange. BIOPLUME III is based on the **U. S. Geologic Survey (USGS) Method of Characteristics Model (Konikow and Bredehoeft, 1989)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BIOPLUME III code was developed primarily to model the natural attenuation of organic contaminants in ground water due to the processes of advection, dispersion, sorption and biodegradation. BIOPLUME III simulates the biodegradation of organic contaminants using a number of aerobic and anaerobic electron acceptors: oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), sulfate, and carbon dioxide. The model solves the transport equation six times to determine the fate and transport of the hydrocarbons and the electron acceptors/reaction by-products. For the case where iron (III) is used as an electron acceptor, the model simulates the production and transport of iron (II) or ferrous iron.\n",
