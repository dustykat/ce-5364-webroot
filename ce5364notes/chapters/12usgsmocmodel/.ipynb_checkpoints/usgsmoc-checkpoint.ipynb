    "The USGS MOC software is a specialized modeling tool developed to simulate groundwater flow, solute transport, and some chemical reactions within aquifers. It is based on numerical modeling principles and has evolved over the years to address complex hydrogeological scenarios. The software employs a modular framework, allowing users (with programming expertise) to tailor it to specific applications, making it an invaluable asset for groundwater professionals and researchers.\n",

    "The conservation area has a southern border that is in contact with the bay with an average salinity of 10,000 ppm. \n",

Prepare a contour map of groundwater heads and a contour map of salinity.  Calculate the area of acceptable habitatbetween the valley-conservation area interface and the bay. The authority uses a groundwater salinity value of 100 ppm as the upper limit of acceptable salinity for useful habitat.
