    "The northern constant head boundary is set at h=600 ft. The southern edge constant boundary varies from 540 ft to 520 ft as one traverses from east to west.  Three water supply wells, W-1, W-2, and W-3 are already in service.  Hydrologic data suggests that the aquifer system has three distinct zones with different hydraulic characteristics.

    "The proposed re-use scheme will inject tracer-labeled waste-water into the aquifer into any of the three injection sites, I-1, I-2, or I-3.  The goal is for the concentration of the non-toxic tracer to never exceede 250 mg/L at the water production wells.  The tracer is added just before injection as a dilution indicator so that the water utility can shut down a well if the water in that well is not sufficiently diluted (much like the tracer added to natural gas to detect leaks).  The tracer concentration at the injection point is 1000 mg/L (the operation goal is the dilute the waste water four fold before it reaches the drinking water wells).\n",

    "1. Can 39 cfs of waste water be injected at I-3 and meet the water quality goal (4:1 dilution at drinking water wells)?\n",
    "2. Is it possible to inject more waste water (higher flow or different location)?\n",
    "3. Find the maximum volume that can be injected (at any or all of the three sites) and meet the water quality goal - this is the \"regulatory assimilative capacity of the system.\"  Does this volume exceed the drinking water demand currently satisfied by the three wells?\n",
    "4. Assume that instead of a non-toxic tracer, the injection water concentration represents some particular water quality parameter.  Assuming that the injection rate never exceedes the demand rate, what is the maximum waste load (mg/sec) that can be put into the aquifer and meet the raw water quality goal?\n",
