# Preface

## Welcome to CE 5364 Groundwater Transport Phenomena

These are the instructor course notes (from which lecture and discussion items are derived).

The environment itself is a [Jupyter{Book}](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) (an interactive on-line notebook, although the interactive part is not working on my server(s) yet).

:::{note}
Many (but not all) underlined/bold items are working hyperlinks to the resource.  Some take you to paywalls, others to the actual item.  You should follow these hyperlinks as you examine these notes.
