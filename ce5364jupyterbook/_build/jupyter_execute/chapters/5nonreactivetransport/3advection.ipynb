    "Advection (convection) is the transport of dissolved or suspended material by motion of the host fluid. The prediction of the direction and amount of material transported requires knowledge of the fluid velocity field (the velocity of a fluid particle).  \n",

    "The advective flux is the product of the quantity of interest (in this case mass of either host fluid or tracer) and the velocity term.  Typically the mean section velocity is used (pipe flow, open channel flow) because fine scale resolution of the velocity field is impossible.  In porous media, the pore velocity or average linear velocity is used.\n",
