# You are developing a response plan for a potential failure of the materials handling containment liner at plant XYZ.  
# 
# ## Area Map
# The figure below depicts the general area where the plant operates.  The golf course is about 4000 meters west of the plant boundary.  The golf course opened about 1980, around the same time as the plant began operations.

# ## Plant Map
# 
# The figure below is a detail map of the plant itself showing the locations of monitoring wells and the materials handling area.

# 
# ## Drilling Logs
# 
# Three monitoring wells were installed when the plant was built and the geologic logs are shown on the figure below.

# 
# ## Water Well
# 
# Some time after the plant began operations a fourth well was installed (PW-1) to provide process water for the plant, but it has never been used.  During development of the well a pumping test was conducted and the data from that test are tabulated below.

# 
# ## Monitoring Data
# 
# The monitoring wells are monitored quarterly, but data are not saved unless there is a detect. The plant safety officer was able to provide the nitrate data tabulated below.  Static long-term water levels in the wells are 81.0m, 80.0m, and 85.0m for MW-1, MW-2, and MW-3, respectively.

# Using these data determine:
# 
# 1. The concentrations at the plant boundary of (1) a radioactive compound that does not interaction with aquifer, but does decay (use the half-life of radioactive iodine as a surrogate for the decay rate of the compound) (2) a soluible compound (assume it does not decay, but does interact with the aquifer; R=1.75), and a chloride tracer (conservative) resulting from a potential catastrophic failure and release at the materials handling area.  Assume the failure releases 1 kg of each material distributed over the area of the materials handling facility.
# 2. Design a line of capture wells along the boundary to capture a 100kg release of any of the above compounds.  The plan is to install the capture wells, but not operate unless the monitoring wells indicate a spill has occurred.  What contaminant level is required in the monitoring wells to initiate a restoration response if the MCL of the materials is 100 mg/L? 
# 
# 
# ### Hints
# 
# All the data are useful â€“ for instance the nitrate data is essentially a tracer from the golf course (fertilizer), thus is can provide estimates of groundwater velocity and dispersivities.  The pumping test can be used to infer transmissivity and informed by the drilling logs give a useable estimate of hydraulic conductivity.  The drilling logs give thickness, etc.  The data will not all agree and you will need to use some judgement on how to incorporate the data into the model.  Your list of assumptions is very important in this exercise, be sure you clearly state each assumption used as you proceede.
