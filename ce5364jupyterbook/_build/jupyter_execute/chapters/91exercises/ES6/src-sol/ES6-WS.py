# ## Problem 1 
# 
# Improper waste disposal practices at an industrial site resulted in contamination of the soil on site by cadmium, a known carcinogen with a slope factor of 6.10 $(\frac{mg}{kg d})^{-1}$. We will consider the risk to off-site residents due to inhalation of airborne soil particles that include the cadmium.  Based on monitoring data, the concentration of cadmium in the air off site is $5.4 \times 10^{-4}~\frac{mg}{m^3}$.

# 2. The cancer risk due to these CInh values for the children and adults.

# ## Problem 4 
# 
# An animal exposure study was performed to determine an acceptable drinking water concentration for a chemical that causes liver disease in rats and is assumed to have a nonzero threshold. The following results were obtained. 
# 
# **Control Group**
# Comparison to historical records: no evidence of premature deaths 
# Time of sacrifice: all surviving rats were sacrificed at 18 months 
# Initial number: 100 
# Number of rats with liver disease: 3 
# 
# **Test Group** 
# Exposure conditions (lowest observed effect): 140 mg/L, 30 mL/d for a median of 12 months 
# Time of sacrifice: all surviving rats were sacrificed at 18 months 
# Comparison of weight and survival curves: no differences between test and control rats 
# Median adult weight: 0.4 kg 
# Initial number exposed: 100 
# Number of rats with liver disease: 12 
# 
# Determine:
# 
# 1. The LOAEL for the rats based on this study.
# 2. The RfD for humans by adjusting for uncertainty. This result is subchronic animal data with no human exposure data available. 
# 3. Convert the RfD to an acceptable drinking water concentration.
